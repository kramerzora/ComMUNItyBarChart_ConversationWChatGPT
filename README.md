# ComMUNItyBarChat_ConversationWChatGPT

##Description

Volunteering with ComMUNIty transit act. I receive the following instructions: <br>
"I'm looking for some graphics to spruce it up, particularly around timelines and voter turnout breakdowns. I think it'd be cute to have slide 8 (Important Upcoming Dates) be a little timeline instead of two bullet points, similarly with slide 13. Could also do charts for the historical voter turnouts and number of votes we need to win" 
Note the last sentence. I can also link the timline graphics I did, but it is less relevant to the conversation I had with ChatGPT. I was very inspired by a podcast with Mico Yuk. I've used ChatGPT to learn a lot with coding, but I thought I could use it with this assignment.
